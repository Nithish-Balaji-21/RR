## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which includes npm)
  * [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Nithish-Balaji-21/RR.git
    cd RR
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend**
    In your terminal, navigate to the `backend` folder, install dependencies, and run the server.

    ```sh
    # Navigate into the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install backend dependencies
    npm install
    ```

    Next, create a **`.env`** file in the `backend` directory and add your environment variables.

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_for_tokens
    ```

    Finally, start the backend server. Keep this terminal open.

    ```sh
    # Run the server
    npm start
    ```

    The backend will now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend**
    Open a **new terminal window** and navigate to the `frontend` folder to set it up.

    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd frontend 
    # Note: If your frontend is in the root, just 'cd ..' from the backend folder.

    # Install frontend dependencies
    npm install
    ```

    Now, run the Angular development server.

    ```sh
    # Serve the Angular app
    ng serve
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will be running and connected to your local backend.
